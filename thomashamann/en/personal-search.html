    	<h2>About my search</h2>
A week ago I returned from a trip in the
Ticino Alps. A lovely Swiss friend, who is an
experienced therapist named Catherine, my
wife Johanna and I accompanied a group of
people doing a one-week &ldquo;visionquest&rdquo; in the
mountains. To receive our hidden, inner pictures
we used, amongst other methods, the
language of our dreams and their picturesque
landscapes.<br /><br />

During these mild late summer days in
the midst of the untouched powerful mountains
and beyond all worldly hurly-burly, more
and more phases of my life came to me. My
seeking and longing for value and meaning
in my life, my detours and wrong tracks in a
world which was falling apart, had not much
in store for me anymore.<br /><br />

&ldquo;What is the sense of my life?<br />
 What is
beyond the facades of the world? Who am
I?&rdquo; were the basic questions for mankind and
myself.<br /><br />

I knew as if I always somewhat sensed
that I am here on this earth to experience joy
and freedom as a birthright &ndash; even if I did not
feel good or if I struggled on the surface of
my actual life situation. I needed to become
aware that alcohol, excesses and other drugs
were an expression of my longing and thirst.<br /><br />

I got busy with magic and symbolism,
contacted the Freemasonry and the Rosicrucians
and followed the path of the Shamans.
Burning my feet walking on fire, taking part
in &ldquo;visionquests&rdquo; and sweating in the sweat
lodges, finally led me to differentiate between
reality and illusion. In the past seven years, I
was close to my spiritual teacher who brought
me in contact with somewhat uncomfortable
and suffering concepts of myself and life,
parallel to my deeper insights and expansion.<br /><br />

Along the way, art has always been a diary
of my emotions, a photo of each situation in
my life. Art has been my path ever since, and
has constantly led me closer to myself and
has been a steady medicine for my soul.<br /><br />

In my work, I have felt and frequently feel
extremely attracted by the footpaths of mankind
until now. This, in addition to the mystery
of life and death. In my studio I surround myself
with enlargements of cave paintings to get
sensitised for their emotional meaning.<br /><br />

Working on a new painting, it is impossible
for me not to break the surface in order
to discover the unknown that would aim to
the secret behind all things. Whether my new
work is satisfying or not, depends on how my
soul resonates and how my yearning is touched.<br /><br />

My discovery serves the need to extend
my limitations in art and in life, continuously
yearning for more freedom, light heartedness
and authenticity in expression. Often it seems
that the path is full of stones and hard to work
on, at other times everything flows freely and
easily.<br /><br />

After all that, I can say with knowing that
what I am in my being is stillness! The expression
is joy, light heartedness, power and
incorporates all creation of life.<br /><br />

&hellip; deep down I found out what I already
knew in the innermost me&hellip; therefore art is a
vehicle to express passion and the joy of life
and deliver it to the world.<br /><br />
