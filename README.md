# raphaelpinel.com - a static personal web page

## Wordpress section

In the root directory, the harp blog used to be a Wordpress website and has been converted to a headless generated static site hosted on Netlify with the help of plugins: `Duplicator`, `Simply Static`

Under the `/web/` directory you will find the web developer presentation web page, a static website made in HTML, CSS and a template.

## How to deploy

- clone the repo
- make a branch and commit changes
- make a PR to master in github
- there is a pipeline in `https://app.netlify.com/sites/love-is-the-answer/overview` that should automatically deploy from the master branch to the Netlify hosting.
